# W205_Final_Project

This application produces a grocery shopper classifier that predicts whether a grocery shopper is an Instacart-type shopper or a standard household grocery shopper.

Execute the file "Run_Application.sh" to produce a model, predict, and create a results table (~30 minutes total run time). Afterward, files "/visualizations/EDA.twb" and "/visualizations/ .twb" can be opened to view the original exploratory data analysis as well as classifier results visualizations (Hadoop connection configuration in Tableau required).

REQUIREMENTS
1. Ensure you have a storage volume attached as '/data' with at least 5 GB available before running "Run_Application.sh."
2. At least 16 GB of memory
3. Hadoop Distributed File System
4. Hive 1.1
5. Python 3 (packages required: Pyhive; Scikit learn; Pickle; Numpy; Pandas; TCLIService)
6. Tableau
